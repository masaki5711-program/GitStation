# forge-core

**Responsibility**: domain primitives and runtime foundations shared by every
server-side crate. Depends only on `forge-errors`.

**Public API**: `RequestId` (`generate`, `parse` — log-safe validation,
`as_str`), `telemetry::init(LogFormat, default_filter)`,
`telemetry::log_failure(&ForgeError, &RequestId)` — the single way a handled
failure is logged (once, at the boundary, level by severity).

**Error codes owned**: none yet (domain newtypes `RepoId`, `UserId`,
`RefName`, `RepoPath` arrive in M1 with their validation codes).

**Gotchas**
- Externally supplied request ids are accepted only if they are short ASCII
  alphanumerics / `-` / `_` — anything else is replaced, never logged raw.
- `telemetry::init` returns `false` if a subscriber is already installed (tests).
